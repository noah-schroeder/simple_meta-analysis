# Home of Simple Meta-Analysis
## A GUI based (largely) on metafor and clubSandwich packages for R. 
This app is still in development, meaning features are being added slowly as requested, however the features available via github should work properly. 
## How to Run Simple Meta-Analysis Locally:

### Option 1: Copy-Paste Scripts
1.Open RunSMAlocal.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noah-schroeder/runSMA/main/runSMAlocal.R <br>
2.Copy all code and paste it into a new file in R Studio<br>
3.Save the file locally on your computer. <br>
4.Highlight all code and click Run. <br>

#### Notes for Programmers that nobody else will probably notice
ShinyLive functionality not currently working. I will probably leave this file structure/github action in place in case ShinyLive is updated to function with the types of code in the app. App works properly if ran locally or at https://noahschroeder.shinyapps.io/SimpleMeta-Analysis/
